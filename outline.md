# Introduction
**Goal:** Scope the thesis to specific systems, present the problematic and the challenge(s), show the structure of the thesis
**Link with previous section:** None (begining of the thesis)
**Link with next chapter:** Next section is the vision that should address the challenge described in this section
**Abstrat:** 
**Contents:**

## Adaptation and abstaction in a nutshell
## Use case: Luxembourg smart grid
## Problematic
## Challenges

# A unified modeling framework
**Goal:** Present and argue for the the unified modeling framework. Present also arguments against this vision and mitigate them.
**Link with the previous chapter:** Address the challenge presented in the previous chapter
**Link with the next chapter:** Now that I have presented the vision, I will describe two contributions which support it.

## Towards a unified modeling framework
**Goal:** Present and argue for the the unified modeling framework
**Link with the previous section:** None (first section)
**Link with the next section:** Here I present pros whereas in the next section I present cons
**Abstrat:**
**Contents:**
<!-- why a modeling framework? -->
- benefits of abstraction
    - remove unecessary details which may complexify the reasoning
    - bring specific view for stakeholders, view that use domain vocabulary / syntax / concepts

<!-- why time and uncertainty as first-class concepts? -->
- time and uncertainty appears in most of DAS
- improve performances
    - structure defined with time and uncertainty in mind
        - enable default index on the temporal aspect
- improve efforts in usage
    - temporal and/or uncertain data directly 

<!-- why combining time and uncertainty in the same structure? -->
- Concern linked: each data as a validity period (more or less long) [not a binary concept]
    - temporal data come with uncertainty
    - uncertainty may come with time

## Away from a unified modeling framework
**Goal:** Present arguments against this vision.
**Link with the previous section:** Here I present cons whereas in the prev. section I present pros
**Link with the next section:** Synthesis the arguments described in and in the prev. sect.

<!-- why a modeling framework? -->
- limitation of abstraction mechanism
    - can introduce overhead that can impact the performances (CPU, memory)
    - lose of control of the full technology stack
    - abstraction may not consider 10% exceptionals cases

<!-- why time and uncertainty as first-class concepts? -->
- uncertainty and time can be defined as normal attributes in existing structures -> reuse of known tools by developers
    - indexes mechanism can also be added on them

<!-- why combining time and uncertainty in the same structure? -->
- Separation of concerns
    - reduce complexity for developers
    - improve their productivity


## Synthesis
**Goal:** Balance the pros with the cons and mitigate the cons

# State of the art
**Goal:** Present the current state of the art approaches and compare my vision and the two contributions with them 
**Link with the previous chapter:** After detailling the vision and the 2 contributions, I present the related work 
**Link with the next chapter:** This comparaison will help to conclude the thesis
