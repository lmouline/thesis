# Abstract
**Goal:** Present the context, the vision defended and the contributions
**Link with previous section:** None (standalone chapter)
**Link with next chapter:** None (standalone chapter)
**Abstrat:** cf. vision defended 

# Introduction
**Goal:** Scope the thesis to specific systems, present the problematic and the challenge(s), show the structure of the thesis
**Link with previous section:** None (begining of the thesis)

## Problematic: data uncertainty and delayed actions

## Challenges: Representation



# A unified modeling framework
**Goal:** Present and argue for the the unified modeling framework. Present also arguments against this vision and mitigate them.
**Link with the previous chapter:** In the previous chapter we 
**Link with the next chapter:** Now that I have presented the vision, I will describe two contributions which support it.

## Towards a unified modeling framework
**Goal:** Present and argue for the the unified modeling framework
**Link with the previous section:** None (first section)
**Link with the next section:** Here I present pros whereas in the next section I present cons

<!-- why a modeling framework? -->
- benefits of abstraction
    - remove unecessary details which may complexify the reasoning
    - simplify the view

<!-- why time and uncertainty as first-class concepts? -->
- time and uncertainty appears in most of DAS
- improve performances
    - structure defined with time and uncertainty in mind
        - enable default index on the temporal aspect
- improve efforts in usage
    - temporal and/or uncertain data directly 

<!-- why combining time and uncertainty in the same structure? -->
- Concern linked: each data as a validity period (more or less long) [not a binary concept]
    - temporal data come with uncertainty
    - uncertainty may come with time

## Away from a unified modeling framework
**Goal:** Present arguments against this vision.
**Link with the previous section:** Here I present cons whereas in the prev. section I present pros
**Link with the next section:** Synthesis the arguments described in and in the prev. sect.

<!-- why a modeling framework? -->
- 

<!-- why time and uncertainty as first-class concepts? -->
- uncertainty and time can be defined as normal attributes in existing structures -> reuse of known tools by developers
    - indexes mechanism can also be added on them

<!-- why combining time and uncertainty in the same structure? -->
- Separation of concerns
    - reduce complexity for developers
    - improve their productivity








## Synthesis
**Goal:** Balance the pros with the cons and mitigate the cons
