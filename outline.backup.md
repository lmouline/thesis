A Unified Modeling Framework to Abstract Knowledge of Dynamically Adaptive System
---

# Abstract

# Introduction
    
    
    - Terminology
    
    
    
    - Intro 
    - Intro DAS
        - Control theory
        - MDE (?)
    - Creos use case
        - Definition/Introduction of a smart grid
        - Explain why there is action is delay
        - Explain why there is uncertain data
    - outline the rest of the thesis

# Motivation

# Challenge
    - 

# State of the art *need some work here*
    - Consideration of effects
        - represent effects
        - learning effects
    - Solution to manipulatre U. data
        - Proba. programing
        - Model U-Data / model uncertainty

# Vision

# Contribution / Validation
*Not be paper driven but message driven*
*Add background section if needed*
    - A temporal model for Interactive Diagnosis of Adaptive Systems
        - here contrib of the ICAC + (next?) journal paper
    - UScript: Managing Uncertainty at the Language Level
        - Reput here contrib of the journal paper

# Limitation
## Temporal model for diagnosis
    - ??

## UScript
    - reput here ( + extend?) limitation put in the paper

# Conclusion

# Discussion & Future work

## Discussion
    - ??

## Future work
    - UC + action/effect:
        - uncertainty on the effects
    - Model UC evaluation
    - temporal uncertainty
    - temporal relation (UML def.)
