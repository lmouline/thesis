In this chapter, we describe the principles of the different software engineering approaches related to this thesis: \glspl{adptSyst}, \glsfirst{mde}, and \glsfirst{sle}.
Moreover, we introduce the elements of the probability theory used in this thesis.
For each of them, we also detail the concepts used in our work, and we explicitly link them to our vision and our contributions.
