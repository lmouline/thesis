\section{Introduction}

In the previous chapter, we see that the adjustment process of \glspl{adptSyst} can be affected by both uncertain data and \glspl{longTermAct}.
In this chapter, we will exemplify the impacts of these elements on a \gls{sg} system, built with Creos Luxembourg, our partner\footnote{Creos Luxembourg is the main grid operator in the country}.
First, we focus on cable load estimation and the impacts of not taking uncertain into consideration. 
We find that this case study is particularly appropriate to exemplify the concepts of uncertainty. 
We highlight and discuss the limitations of existing approaches when handling such scenarios and show how and when our language is superior to these approaches.
Then, we concentrate on the reconfiguration feature of \glspl{sg} and the effect of \gls{longTermAct}.
We also extend this example with other examples from other domain such as cloud infrastructure.

The remainder of this chapter is as follows.
We first give an overview of a \gls{sg} in~\Cref{sec:example:sg}.
Then, we detail our motivating example for \gls{duc} in~\Cref{sec:example:duc} and for \gls{longTermAct} in~\Cref{sec:example:sg}.
