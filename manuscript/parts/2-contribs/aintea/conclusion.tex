\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:aintea:conclusion}

Data are inherently uncertain.
This uncertainty can modify the understanding of the elements represented by these data.
Furthermore, it may damage the decision made upon this knowledge.
Managing this uncertainty calls for a strong understanding of probability theory.
However, it can be far from developers expertise.
In order to help them manipulating this uncertainty, we define \langName{}, a language which integrates concepts related to data uncertainty.
Mainly, we define uncertain data types and we map uncertainty propagation to arithmetic, boolean, and comparison operators.
In addition, we define operators specific to the manipulation of the uncertainty representation.
In our validation, we show that our language is as concise as state-of-the-art solutions.
Contrary to these solutions, we also show that our solution can detect errors earlier.
Thanks to the semantics, which supports uncertainty, errors message help developers in their development of algorithms that use uncertain data.
