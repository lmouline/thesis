%\section{Introduction}
%\label{sec:introduction}

%The increasing availability of big data and machine learning techniques brings out the importance of data in modern software systems.
%Data become a cornerstone piece to autonomously derive decisions from them, or at least to support decision-making processes.
%This trend has also been recognized by official institutions, like Datalandscape\footnote{\url{http://datalandscape.eu}}, a European institution analyzing the so-called \textit{data market}.
%A recent example is Industry 4.0~\cite{DBLP:journals/bise/LasiFKFH14}, where factories are increasingly automated by analyzing data coming from different sensors and controlling processes based on this.
%
%However, \textbf{data are inherently uncertain}. 
%Data collected from sensors contain the uncertainty due to their accuracy and failure rate~\cite{DBLP:conf/asplos/BornholtMM14, metrology2008evaluation} or malicious false data injection~\cite{liang20172015}.
%Uncertainty can also be the result of human errors when entering data in a system.
%Also, simulation or forecast techniques carry uncertainty in their results.
%The same counts for all machine learning algorithms.
%
%A software system \textbf{not considering this uncertainty would lead to a potentially catastrophic situation}, as a misperception of the reality of the system may lead to wrong decisions~\cite{DBLP:conf/asplos/BornholtMM14}.
%Uncertainty blurs the human's or algorithm's understanding of a situation or system state.
%James Bornholt shows in~\cite{bornholt2013abstractions} that computing the average speed during a walking activity and ignoring the uncertainty of GPS data lead to unrealistic situations such a walking speed equals to 95 km/h.
%Another example in the smart grid domain is the load approximation.
%Ignoring the uncertainty of the grid topology may lead to a false detection of an overloading incident.\looseness-1
%
%On the one hand, developers ignore this uncertainty.
%As shown by James Bornholt~\cite{bornholt2013abstractions}, over 100 popular applications which use GPS location, only one considers the uncertainty of data manipulated.
%On the other hand, scientific computing software devotes a significant portion of their code to the management of uncertainty.
%This claim is supported by the existence of frameworks such as the GUM~\cite{metrology2008evaluation}, made by the Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology\footnote{\url{https://www.bipm.org/en/committees/jc/jcgm/}}, or OpenTurns~\cite{baudin2017openturns}, a framework supported by companies expert or using scientific computing.
%
%\textbf{Developing such software systems requires significant expertise in handling uncertainty (probability and statistics theory)} to efficiently manipulate and interpret data. 
%Several techniques based on probability theory and fuzzy logic have been proposed~\cite{zadeh1996fuzzy,metrology2008evaluation,shafer1992dempster} to handle uncertainty. 
%The application of these techniques requires a deep understanding of the underlying theories and is a time-consuming task~\cite{DBLP:conf/quatic/VallecilloMO16}.
%Moreover, it is hard to test and, perhaps most importantly, very error-prone.
%
%Different works implement the theory behind uncertainty management in the form of libraries or frameworks~\cite{url:InferNET18, baudin2017openturns}.  
%In this chapter, we argue that using a library or a framework to handle uncertainty is efficient in terms of reusability but it fails to prevent the most common errors during development time. 
%For example, all errors and bugs related to type inconsistencies and mismatches (semantics error) will be discovered only at runtime.
%As done by Vallecillo~\etal in~\cite{DBLP:conf/quatic/VallecilloMO16}, we argue that \textbf{an efficient solution to handle data uncertainty in software systems should be realized at the language level itself with a first-class citizen}. 
%Having it on the language level enhances library and framework-based approaches by adding a static, uncertainty-aware type system which is able to detect type errors at development time.\looseness-1

In this chapter, we present the contribution that tackles Sub-challenge \#1 described in~\Cref{sec:intro:scope}, concerning \gls{duc}.
Our contribution is split in three parts.
\begin{itemize}
%	\vspace{-0.5em}
	\setlength\itemsep{-0.3em}
    \item Description and definition of the main concepts and operators to introduce in a language with uncertainty as a first-class citizen. Doing so, developers will be able to manipulate uncertain and certain data in a similar way, hiding complex concepts behind ones they are used to. 
    \item An uncertainty-aware static type checker enabling the design-time detection of programming errors. This type checker can be used as \textit{implicit documentation}, which helps developers in implementing uncertainty-aware algorithms.
    \item We implement these two contributions in the \langName{} language, publicly available\footnote{\url{https://github.com/lmouline/aintea/}}. An overview of this language is depicted in \Cref{fig:intro:contrib:aintea}. Then, we use a real-world case study, built with our partner Creos S.A., to answer the two following research questions: 
    \begin{itemize}
%   		\vspace{-0.5em}
		\setlength\itemsep{-0.3em}
    	\item \textit{RQ1:} Does the uncertainty management have an impact on the conciseness of a language? 
		\item \textit{RQ2:} Can the type system detect errors related to uncertainty management?
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Our use-case implementation shows first that our approach does not impact the conciseness of the language (RQ1).
Second, it highlights the feasibility and the advantages (RQ2) of an uncertainty-aware type checking system on the language level.

The remainder of this chapter is as follows.
In \Cref{sec:aintea:duc}, we present and discuss the main concepts and operators for uncertainty management as a first-class citizen of a language. 
\Cref{sec:aintea:validation} presents our \langName{} implementation and validates the design time error detection and its impact on language conciseness. 
\Cref{sec:aintea:conclusion} concludes and presents some open research perspectives.
