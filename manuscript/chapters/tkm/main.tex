\chapter[TKM: a temporal knowledge model]{TKM: a temporal knowledge model to represent actions, their contexts and their impacts}
\chapterPage{
Adaptation processes are executed with a high frequency to react to any incidents whereas the execution of their decisions is constrained by the executions of delayed actions.
We identified two problems that result from these different paces.
First, unfinished actions, together with their expected effects, over time are not considered, leading upcoming analysis phases potentially make suboptimal decisions.
Second, explanation of the adaptation process remains challenging due to the lack of tracing ability of current approaches.
To tackle this problem, we first propose a knowledge formalism to define the concept of a decision. 
Second, we describe a novel temporal knowledge model to represent, store and query decisions as well as their relationship with the knowledge (context, requirements, and actions).
We validate our approach through a use case based on the smart grid at Luxembourg. We also demonstrate its scalability both in terms of execution time and consumed memory.
