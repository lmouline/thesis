\chapter[TKM: a temporal knowledge model]{A temporal knowledge meta-model to represent, reason and diagnose decisions, their circumstances and their impacts}
\chapterPage{
Adaptation processes are executed with a high frequency to react to any incident whereas the delay for decision applications are constrained by the time to execute the delayed actions.
We identified two problems that result from these different paces.
First, not considered unfinished actions, together with their expected effects, over time lead upcoming analysis phases potentially make suboptimal decisions.
Second, explanations of adaptation processes remain challenging due to the lack of tracing ability of current approaches.
To tackle this problem, we first propose a knowledge formalism to define the concept of a decision. 
Second, we describe a novel temporal knowledge model to represent, store and query decisions as well as their relationship with the knowledge (context, requirements, and actions).
We validate our approach through a use case based on the smart grid at Luxembourg.
We also demonstrate its scalability both in terms of execution time and consumed memory.
