\chapterPage{
In this chapter, we first propose a knowledge formalism to define the concept of a decision. 
Second, we describe a novel temporal knowledge model to represent, store and query decisions as well as their relationship with the knowledge (context, requirements, and actions).
We validate our approach through a use case based on the smart grid at Luxembourg.
We also demonstrate its scalability both in terms of execution time and consumed memory.
