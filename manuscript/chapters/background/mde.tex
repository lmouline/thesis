%\subsection{Models@run.time}
%The models@run.time paradigm~\cite{DBLP:journals/computer/MorinBJFS09,DBLP:journals/computer/BlairBF09} is a well-known realisation of the MAPE-K loop to handle the challenges faced in self-adaptive systems development.
%It extends model-driven engineering (MDE) concepts by spanning the use of models from design time to runtime (\ie during the execution of a system).
%The model, as an abstraction of a real system, can be used during runtime to reason about the state of the actual system. 
%A conceptual link between the model and the real system allows modifying the actual system through the model and vice versa.
%Models in MDE provide semantically rich ways to define contexts that can be used in reasoning activities. 
%The models@run.time paradigm uses meta-models to define the domain concepts of a real system together with its surrounding environment. 
%In other words, it specifies which elements can be used by the model.
%Consequently, the runtime model depicts an abstract and yet rich representation of the system context that conforms to (is an instance of) its meta-model.
%In this work, we seek to use the models@run.time paradigm to represent, reason, and update the context of a system.

%\subsection{Framework used in this thesis: GreyCat Modelling}
%
% 
%In the \gls{mde} community, the most famous framework is the \gls{emf}\footnote{\url{https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/}}\cite{steinberg2008emf}.
%
%
%
%In this work, we will use the GreyCat Modelling Framework, publicly available on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/datathings/greycat/tree/master/modeling}}.
%This framework is the result of the thesis of Hartmann~\cite{}.
%As we do in this work, he argued that modern modelling framework should introduce time as a first class concept.
%Using this framework, we will define the model used to trace back decisions, their expected effects, and their circumstances.
