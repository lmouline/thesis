In this chapter, we describe the principles of the different software engineering approaches related to this thesis: \glspl{adptSyst}, \glsfirst{mde}, \glsfirst{sle}, and probability theory.
For each of them, we also detail the concepts used in our work, and we explicitly link them to our vision and our contributions.
