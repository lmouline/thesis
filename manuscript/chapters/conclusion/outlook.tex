\section{Outlook}

In a previous work, Hartmann \etal \cite{DBLP:conf/seke/0001FNMKT14, DBLP:conf/models/Moawad0FNKT15} extended the \gls{m@rt} paradigm with a time dimension on the \gls{model} elements.
We pushed further this vision by also arguing for the integration of \gls{duc}.
Doing so, we advocate for the integration of time and uncertainty management approaches into modern a modelling framework.
This framework should enable designer to reflect the evolution of the system augmented with a confidence level.

In this thesis, we target \gls{adptSyst}.
But we strongly think that time and uncertainty are common in other domain such as scientific computing or simulator engineering.
Therefore, we believe that our contribution and vision can be adapted to be applied in a more general context.
