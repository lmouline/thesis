\section{Introduction}

%% Research questions
\paragraph{Delayed actions}
General research question:
\begin{center}
	\textbf{RQ1}: Do current state of the art solutions allow modeling and reasoning over delayed actions?  
\end{center}

Sub research questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{RQ1.1}: How current approaches model the evolution of the context and/or the evolution of the behavior of systems over time?
	\item \textbf{RQ1.2}: Do these solutions model actions, their circumstances and their effects?
	\item \textbf{RQ1.3}: What are the solutions that enable the reasoning over the evolving context and/or behavior of systems?
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Uncertainty}

%% Methodology
Snowballing approach~\cite{DBLP:conf/ease/Wohlin14}
