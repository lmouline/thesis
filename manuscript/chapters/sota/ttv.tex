\section{Threat to validity}
\label{sec:sota:validity}

In this section, we discussed several threats to validity that may damage the results of our review.

To perform this review, we use a strategy inspired by the snowballing methodology~\cite{DBLP:conf/ease/Wohlin14}.
However, due to a lack of resources, we do not adequately perform it.
Contrary to what we should have done, we did not apply the backward and forward propagation on all the selected papers.
Additionally, as mentioned by the authors, the quality of the results of a review that follow this methodology highly depends on the starting set, which can suffer from bias.

Moreover, the results of a review are impacted by the accuracy of the data extraction step and the research questions formulated.
In this case, no discussion has been done around the formulation of the research questions.
And the data extraction has been performed by a unique person, which will increase the inaccuracy.
