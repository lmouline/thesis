\section{Threat to validity}
\label{sec:sota:validity}

In this section, we discussed several threat to validity that may damage the results of our review.

To perform this review, we use a strategy inspired from the snowballing methodology~\cite{DBLP:conf/ease/Wohlin14}.
However, due to a lack of resources, we do not fully perform it.
Contrary to what should have been done, we did not apply the backward and forward propagation on all the selected papers.
Additionaly, as mentioned by the authors, the quality of the results of a review that follow this methodology highly depends on the primary set, which can suffer from a bias.

Moreover, the result of a review are impacted by the accuracy of the data extraction step and the research questions formulated.
In this case, no discussion have been done around the formulation of the questions.
And, the data extraction has been performed by a unique person, which will increase the inaccuracy.
