This chapter reviews works related to the one presented in this dissertation.
This review has been driven by two research questions.
The first one aims at investigating state-of-the art solutions that model \glspl{adptSyst} to see those that consider \gls{longTermAct}.
With the second research question, we search current approaches that handle \gls{duc}.
Our review shows that none of the studies performed until now take into account \gls{longTermAct}.
Additionally, it shows that different solutions exist to model \gls{duc} but some efforts need to be performed to provide solutions at a higher level.
