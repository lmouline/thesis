\section{Problem statement}

\textbf{Data are uncertain, actions have delayed effects, and the behavior of \glspl{adptSyst} is emergent.}

Data are, almost by definition, uncertain and developers always work with estimates.
This is due to how data are collected.
We can identify three different sources.
They can .....
\textbf{Uncertainty impacts the understanding of the global situation}

Actions....
\textbf{if the frequency of the monitoring stage is lower than the time of action effects to be measurable}


Behavior ...
\textbf{The behavior cannot be perfectly known at design time or inferred from the set of executed actions.}
