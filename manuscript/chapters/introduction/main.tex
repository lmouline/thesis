Model-driven engineering methodology and dynamically adaptive systems approach are combined to tackle challenges brought by systems nowadays. 
After introducing these two software engineering techniques, we describe five problems that we identified for such systems: data uncertainty, actions with long-term effects, emergent behaviours of such systems, different evolution paces of the subparts, and the temporal dimension in their structures and behaviours. 
We present the challenges that come with these problems. 
Before describing the two contributions of this thesis, we scope to the addressed sub-challenges tackled.
