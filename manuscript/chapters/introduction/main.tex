Model-driven engineering methodology and dynamically adaptive systems approach are combined to tackle new challenges brought by systems nowadays. 
After introducing these two software engineering techniques, I give one example of such systems: the Luxembourg smart grid. 
I will also use this example to highlight two of the problematics: uncertainty of data and delays in actions. 
Among the different challenges which are implied by them, I present the global one addressed by the vision defended in this thesis: modeling of temporal and uncertain data. 
This global challenge can be addressed by splitting up in several ones. I present two of them, which are directly tackled by two contributions presented in this thesis.
