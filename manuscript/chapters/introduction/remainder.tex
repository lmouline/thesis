\section{Structure of the document}

We split the remaining part of this document into eight chapters.
First, \Cref{chapt:background} describes the necessary background of the thesis.
We present concepts related to \gls{mde} and \glspl{adptSyst}.
Based on this background, we show the gap of the current state of the art in \Cref{chapt:sota}.
Then, in \Cref{chapt:vision}, we detail the vision defended in this thesis.
We present the arguments in support of it and those that are in opposition.
\Cref{chapt:aintea} and \Cref{chapt:tkm} described our two contributions, which go towards the defended vision.
The former details our language, \langName, that integrates uncertainty as a first-class citizen.
The latter explains our temporal metamodel that can represent past and ongoing decisions with their circumstances and effects.
Finally, we conclude in \Cref{chapt:conclusion}, and we present a set of perspectives of our work.
