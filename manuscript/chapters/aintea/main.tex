\chapter{Ainâ€™tea: managing data uncertainty at the language level}
\label{chapt:aintea}
\chapterPage{
After identifying and discussing the key concepts associated with data uncertainty, this chapter presents \langName{}, a language that integrates them directly into the grammar, type system and semantics part. 
To validate and exemplify our approach, we apply it to a smart-grid scenario and compare it to framework-based approaches.
We show that developers benefit from the language semantics and type system which guide them to manipulate uncertain data without deep probability theory knowledge.}
