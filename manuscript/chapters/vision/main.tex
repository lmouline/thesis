\chapter{A unified modelling framework}
\label{chapt:vision}
\chapterPage{As argued in the introduction section, adaptation combined with abstraction comes with a novel challenge: the representation of uncertain data and delayed action. In this chapter, we present a vision concerning a modelling framework that should consider uncertainty and time as first-class concepts. We first argue towards this vision. Before detailing the synthesis of this vision, we show arguments against this vision. To do so, we answered with pros and cons to three questions: why do we need a modelling framework? why time and uncertainty should be put as first-class concepts? why should time and uncertainty combined in the same structure?}
